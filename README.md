# WatermarkOntology
A watermark ontology based on the WZIS classification schema.

For the terminology and examples, see:
https://www.wasserzeichen-online.de/wzis/index.php?sprache=en

The ontology has been built by Nicole Eichenberger during a project at the Berlin State Library in 2018.

I would like to thank Robert Giel (Berlin State Library), Franz Schollmeyer (Leipzig University Library), Christian Stein (Humboldt University Berlin) and Katrin Sturm (Leipzig University Library) for their help during the project.
